# Conway's Game of Life ‚Äî Retro Edition üïπÔ∏èüß¨

A whimsical, retro-inspired take on Conway‚Äôs Game of Life.  
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: no frameworks, no build tools, just pure browser fun.

Inspired by Conway‚Äôs original rules, retro UIs, and the idea of digital life forms in small containers.  
This is less a tool and more a toy. A little machine to watch things live and fade.


## What is the Game of Life?

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in the 1970s.  
It‚Äôs a zero-player simulation where simple rules produce surprisingly complex behavior.  
Pixels (or ‚Äúcells‚Äù) live or die depending on their neighbors, generating patterns that evolve over time.

## Features

- CRT-style display with a retro glow and pixel grid
- Simple, tactile controls: start, stop, regenerate
- Adjustable seed size and live-cell ratio
- Stops automatically when the simulation reaches stability
- Fully browser-based ‚Äî no setup or dependencies
